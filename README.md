# NYC-TLC-Analysis
NYC TLC Trip Data Analysis – Revenue Optimization Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Dataset to discover insights that can help taxi and limousine companies optimize revenue, improve pricing strategy, and understand factors influencing fare amounts.

The analysis was performed in a Python Jupyter Notebook, cleaned and prepared for visualization in Tableau, where an interactive dashboard was created.

🚀 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the TLC trip dataset.

Analyze factors that influence fare amounts and total revenue.

Identify strategies to optimize pricing.

Export a clean dataset for Tableau dashboarding.

Create visualizations for actionable insights.

📂 Repository Contents
File	Description
NYC_TLC_Analysis.ipynb	Full Python notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, and export.
cleaned_tlc_data.csv	Clean dataset ready for Tableau (generated by the notebook).
tableau_dashboard/	Folder containing dashboard images or packaged workbook (optional).
README.md	Project documentation (this file).
🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The notebook performs the following cleaning workflow:

Removes duplicates

Filters out invalid trip distances and negative fare amounts

Fixes datetime formats (lpep_pickup_datetime, lpep_dropoff_datetime)

Removes extreme outliers based on IQR

Standardizes categorical fields

Checks missing values and handles them appropriately

Validates latitude/longitude boundaries

📊 Key Analyses Performed

1️⃣ Relationship Between Trip Distance and Fare Amount

Shows how pricing correlates with distance and identifies inefficient trips.

2️⃣ Analysis of Passenger Count Impact on Revenue

Finds which passenger groups generate the highest average fare per trip.

3️⃣ Temporal Analysis

Peak hours

Weekday vs weekend demand

Seasonal demand changes

4️⃣ Vendor & Payment Method Performance

Which vendors produce higher revenue
Patterns of payment success

5️⃣ Geospatial Analysis

Density maps to identify revenue hotspots.

💡 Key Insights & Revenue Optimization Strategies

Based on the notebook findings:

✔️ 1. Implement Dynamic Pricing (Surge)

Peak hours and high-demand zones show significantly higher revenue potential.

✔️ 2. Encourage Efficient Long-Distance Trips

Trips above 5–7 miles show disproportionately higher fare revenue.

✔️ 3. Improve Operations in High-Revenue Zones

Density maps identify consistent revenue hotspots.

✔️ 4. Optimize Pricing for Passenger Groups

Groups of 2–3 passengers consistently produce the best fare averages.

✔️ 5. Promote Cashless & Digital Payment Adoption

Digital payments correlate with higher fare completion and fewer disputes.

✔️ 6. Improve Vendor Performance

Underperforming vendors can adjust pricing or improve service quality.
